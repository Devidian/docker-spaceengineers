# Space Engineers Dedicated Debian Docker Container

First of all thanks to [7thCore](https://github.com/7thCore) and [mmmaxwwwell](https://github.com/mmmaxwwwell) for their great prework making a linux dedicated server for Space Engineers real!

I took parts of their projects to create this one (see credits)

# Why?

I wanted to have a more cleaner docker container with less dependencies (integrate sesrv-script parts instead of wget the whole script) and a little more configuration through composer files.

# KeyFacts

| Key         | Value                |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| OS          | Debian 11 (Bullseye) |
| Wine        | 6.0.2~bullseye-1     |
| Docker size | ~4.6GB uncompressed  |
| Build Time  | ~ 7-8 Minutes        |
| Ram  | Min 4GB        |
| CPU Cores  | Min 2        |

# How to use

First you have to use the `Space Engineers Dedicated Server` Tool to setup your world.

(detailed instructions follow when requested)

After you have saved your world upload it (the instance directory) to your docker host machine `/appdata/space-engineers/instances/`.

## Using docker-compose with premade docker image

Create a `docker-compose.yml` (see example below) and execute `docker-compose up -d`

Do not forget to rename `TestInstance` with your instance name!

### example composer file (just copy and adjust)

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  se-server:
    build: .
    image: spaceengineers:latest
    container_name: se-ds-docker
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      # left side: your docker-host machine
      # right side: the paths in the image (!!do not change!!)
      - /appdata/space-engineers/instances:/appdata/space-engineers/instances
      - /appdata/space-engineers/SpaceEngineersDedicated:/appdata/space-engineers/SpaceEngineersDedicated
      - /appdata/space-engineers/steamcmd:/root/.steam
    ports:
      - target: 27016
        published: 27016
        protocol: udp
        mode: host
    environment:
      - WINEDEBUG=-all
      - INSTANCE_NAME=TestInstance
      - PUBLIC_IP=1.2.3.4
      # public ip required for healthcheck
```

# Build the image yourself from source

Download this repository and run `docker-compose up -d`

# Use the docker image as source for your own image

If you want to extend the image create a `Dockerfile` and use `FROM devidian/spaceengineers:latest`

# FAQ

## Can i run mods?

Yes as they are saved in your world, the server will download them on the first start.

## Can i contribute?

Sure, feel free to submit merge requests or issues if you have anything to improve this project. If you just have a question, use Github Discussions.

# Known issues

- **VRage Remote Client**
  - I personally could not manage to connect with te remote client, if anyone gets a connection please tell me (and maybe how you fixed it)
- **Error: No IP assigned.**
  - This is an issue in the official dedicated server files that can only be fixed by keen [see this issue](https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/SpaceEngineers/issues/611) FOOTNOTE: I have added a check to kill it for quicker restart.
